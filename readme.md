Hello Cooper, version 2. Because <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN7k-KjE8wI">there's a fish in the percolator</a>.

This plugin was originally created in 2007, after being formally introduced to <em>Twin Peaks</em>by my friend Molly.  If you're a fan of the show, you know already that it features some really odd, awkward, unsettling, and all-around hilarious one-liners.  And really, what more could you expect from the mind of David Lynch?

Hello Cooper is a one-file Wordpress plugin that adds quotes to the  administrative dashboard. If you're familiar with the classic <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/hello-dolly/">Hello Dolly</a> plugin, this works in the same way. The key difference is the font size, which is larger in Hello Cooper.
